//Assertions: You need to ensure that once req rises, ack must arrive within 3â€“7 cycles, but if req deasserts before ack, the requirement is voided. Write a single property that handles this cancellation cleanly (no vacuous pass), and explain how you avoided overlapping obligations on repeated req pulses.
