//Constraints: You have rand bit [9:0] A; Constrain elements to be pairwise distinct, each divisible by 5 or 7 (at least one), and the arrayâ€™s sorted copy must be strictly increasing by at least 3 between adjacent elements. Show constraints that scale and discuss any pitfalls with O(n^2) distinctness.
